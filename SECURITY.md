The intent-graph service is part of the UnisonOS control plane and is expected to run in trusted environments alongside the orchestrator.

If you believe you have found a security issue in unison-intent-graph, please follow the responsible disclosure guidance in the UnisonOS security docs or open a private security advisory on GitHub instead of filing a public issue.
